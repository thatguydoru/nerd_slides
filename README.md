# Nerd Slides
Create boring slideshows while looking like a nerd.

## Motivation
I made this to study web components. Nothing more.

## Will this be improved?
If I look back on it again, maybe.

## Running the examples
A directory web server is needed. I recommend using Python's http server and call it a day.

- python: `python -m http.server`
